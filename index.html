    <h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
    <p>Conway's Game of Life is a simple simulation that creates artificial 'life' on a grid, each cell of which is
    either alive or not. Each generation (turn), the following rules are applied:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any live cell with fewer than two or more than three live neighbors dies.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A neighbor is defined as any adjacent cell, including diagonally adjacent ones.</p>
    <p>Note that these rules are applied to the whole grid at once, not one square at a time. That means the
    counting of neighbors is based on the situation at the start of the generation, and changes happening to
    neighbor cells during this generation should not influence the new state of a given cell.</p>
    <p>When the user checks or unchecks the checkboxes, their changes should be included when computing the next
    generation.</p>
